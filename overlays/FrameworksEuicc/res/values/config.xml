    <!-- An array of device capabilities defined by GSMA SGP.22 v2.0.
         The first item is the capability name that the device supports. The second item is the
         major version. The minor and revision versions are default to 0s.
         The device capabilities and their definition in the spec are:
             gsm : gsmSupportedRelease
             utran : utranSupportedRelease
             cdma1x : cdma2000onexSupportedRelease

    <!-- Device-specific array of SIM slot indexes which are are embedded eUICCs.
         e.g. If a device has two physical slots with indexes 0, 1, and slot 1 is an
         eUICC, then the value of this array should be:
             <integer-array name="non_removable_euicc_slots">
                 <item>1</item>
             </integer-array>
         If a device has three physical slots and slot 1 and 2 are eUICCs, then the value of
         this array should be:
             <integer-array name="non_removable_euicc_slots">
                <item>1</item>
                <item>2</item>
             </integer-array>
         This is used to differentiate between removable eUICCs and built in eUICCs, and should
         be set by OEMs for devices which use eUICCs. -->

    <!-- Number of physical SIM slots on the device. This includes both eSIM and pSIM slots, and
         is not necessarily the same as the number of phones/logical modems supported by the device.
         For example, a multi-sim device can have 2 phones/logical modems, but 3 physical slots,
         or a single SIM device can have 1 phones/logical modems, but 2 physical slots (one eSIM
         and one pSIM) -->
